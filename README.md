'tiny beauty' is a Flask web application for small beauty salon or beauty parlour. In present state it is kind of CRM-system (Customer Relationship Management). It is designed to keep track of our customers and services beeing provided for our customers.
### Usage
This app allows users, which are authorized employees of our beauty salon, to sign in. When 'logged in' users may see the list of existing customers. It is an HTML table with every row representing a separate customer. Logged in users can search for existing customer, view and edit detailed info about each customer or add a new one. Within a customer's info page a user can also view the orders history table, add a new customer's order, view and edit existing customer's orders details.
#### customers.html
This page represents customers' table. Every row holds data for a single customer in the columns: 'ID', 'Unique ID', 'First name', 'Last name', 'Email'. The 'View customer' column holds the button which redirects a user to the ['customer_info' page](#customer_infohtml) which is described [further](#customer_infohtml). Search filters are provided at the top of customers' table. If no user is found by provided parameters and when nearby 'add new customer' button pressed then nonempty values of search fields are added to the corresponding fields for a new customer.
#### customer_info.html
This page provides detailed information for a selected customer or a new one beeing added. Customer's detailed information consists of the following fields: 'ID', 'Unique ID', 'First name', 'Last name', 'Gender', 'Email', 'Skin type', 'Contraindications', 'Precautions'. The 'ID' field is immutable. The 'Unique ID' field allows to identify several customers with same names, the 'Unique ID' is generated automatically but can be altered manually. Manually provided 'Unique ID' must be unique within all customers. 'Skin type' can be one of 5(five) default types (according to the American Academy of Dermatology): 'oily', 'dry', 'normal', 'combined' (oily+dry), 'sensitive'. Every visit of the beauty salon by a customer is called 'Service order'. All visits of the salon by a customer are kept in the 'Customer orders' table of the customer_info page. Each row represents a separate service order and includes columns: 'ID', 'Number', 'Date', 'Skin condition', 'Beautician', 'Order status'. Where 'ID' is a service order id, 'Number' is a service order unique number for additional identification of service orders, 'Date' is service order appointment date, 'Skin condition' represents skin condition as examined during the visit by the beautician who is mentioned in the 'Beautician' column. The 'View order' column has a button which redirects 
a user to the ['service order details' page](#svc_order_detailshtml) with the details of the visit.
#### svc_order_details.html
The Order details page provides a detailed information for the selected order or the new one beeing added. Basic information is devided into to areas: 'Order info' and 'Customer info'. As far as it is an order detail page, 'Customer info' is immutable. Particularly, 'Contraindications' and 'Precautions' fields are displayed here for a beautcian's convenience. 'Order info' area contains such data-fields which briefly describe a particular order. The 'ID' field is immutable. The 'Unique ID' field is generated automaticaly but it can be also altered manualy. The 'Order status' can have one of 3(three) default values: 'confirmed', 'rendered', 'canceled'. During assessment and treatment a beautician switches 'Order status' to 'rendered'. The 'Order placed date' field is immutable and indicates when a current order was created. The 'Appointment date' field should match with the actual start time and it can be altered using a datetime picker. The 'Beautician' field indicates which therapist has provided treatment during the current session. It is a selection field with the list of all users who have the role 'beautician'. The 'Description' field is for any additional important information regarding current treatment session to be mentioned by a beautician.

They include both services stored in the 'Treatment plan' table and home care products kept in the 'Home care recommendations' table.
